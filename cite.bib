  abstract = {The Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP), in which events have to be scheduled repeatedly over a given period, is a complex and well-known discrete problem
with numerous real-world applications. One of them is to find periodic timetables which is economically important, but difficult
to handle mathematically, since even finding a feasible solution to this problem is known to be NP-hard. On the other hand,
there are recent achievements like the computation of the timetable of the Dutch railway system that impressively demonstrate
the applicability and practicability of the mathematical model. In this paper we propose different approaches to improve the
modulo network simplex algorithm [8], which is a powerful heuristic for the PESP problem, by exploiting improved search methods in the modulo simplex tableau
and larger classes of cuts to escape from the many local optima. Numerical experiments on railway instances show that our
algorithms are able to handle problems of the size of the German intercity railway network.},

  abstract = {In the planning process of public transportation companies, designing the timetable is among the core planning steps. In particular in the case of periodic (or cyclic) services, the Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP) is well-established to compute high-quality periodic timetables.

We are considering algorithms for computing good solutions for the very basic PESP with no additional extra features as add-ons. The first of these algorithms generalizes several primal heuristics that had been proposed in the past, such as single-node cuts and the modulo network simplex algorithm. We consider partitions of the graph, and identify so-called delay cuts as a structure that allows to generalize several previous heuristics. In particular, when no more improving delay cut can be found, we already know that the other heuristics could not improve either.

The second of these algorithms turns a strategy, that had been discussed in the past, upside-down: Instead of gluing together the network line-by-line in a bottom-up way, we develop a divide-and-conquer-like top-down approach to separate the initial problem into two easier subproblems such that the information loss along their cutset edges is as small as possible.

We are aware that there may be PESP instances that do not fit well the separator setting. Yet, on the RxLy-instances of PESPlib in our experimental computations, we come up with good primal solutions and dual bounds. In particular, on the largest instance (R4L4), this new separator approach, which applies a state-of-the-art solver as subroutine, is able to come up with better dual bounds than purely applying this state-of-the-art solver in the very same time.},

As a mathematical model to deal with such problems, we introduce ``perioidic networks''. The general discussion of this concept allows to give formulas for network caused waiting times at all junctions. Based on this results we formulate the optimization task to find timetables which minimize a global objective depending on all local waiting times. In general, these ``periodic programs'' are NP-hard. We present a branch and bound approach. As shown by computational results for the case of a linear objective, the use of the Hermite normal form considerably improves the performance of the algorithm. For unconstrained problems we give a polynomially working method to find the lexicographic best solution.},

  abstract = {Planning a public transportation system is a multi-objective problem which includes among others line planning, timetabling, and vehicle scheduling. For each of these planning stages, models are known and advanced solution techniques exist. Some of the models focus on costs, others on passengers' convenience. Setting up a transportation system is usually done by optimizing each of these stages sequentially. In this paper we argue that instead of optimizing each single step further and further it would be more beneficial to consider the whole process in an integrated way. To this end, we develop and discuss a generic, bi-objective model for integrating line planning, timetabling, and vehicle scheduling. We furthermore propose an eigenmodel which we apply for these three planning stages and show how it can be used for the design of iterative algorithms as heuristics for the integrated problem. The convergence of the resulting iterative approaches is analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Moreover, we propose an agenda for further research in this field.},
