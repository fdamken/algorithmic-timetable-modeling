  abstract = {The Periodic Event Scheduling Problem (PESP), in which events have to be scheduled repeatedly over a given period, is a complex and well-known discrete problem
with numerous real-world applications. One of them is to find periodic timetables which is economically important, but difficult
to handle mathematically, since even finding a feasible solution to this problem is known to be NP-hard. On the other hand,
there are recent achievements like the computation of the timetable of the Dutch railway system that impressively demonstrate
the applicability and practicability of the mathematical model. In this paper we propose different approaches to improve the
modulo network simplex algorithm [8], which is a powerful heuristic for the PESP problem, by exploiting improved search methods in the modulo simplex tableau
and larger classes of cuts to escape from the many local optima. Numerical experiments on railway instances show that our
algorithms are able to handle problems of the size of the German intercity railway network.},

  abstract = {For a fixed time interal served railway system we consider the problem to find a timetable such that for a selected class of change possibilities the arising waiting time is minimal. As a mathematical model to deal with such problems, we introduce ``perioidic networks''. The general discussion of this concept allows to give formulas for network caused waiting times at all junctions. Based on this results we formulate the optimization task to find timetables which minimize a global objective depending on all local waiting times. In general, these ``periodic programs'' are NP-hard. We present a branch and bound approach. As shown by computational results for the case of a linear objective, the use of the Hermite normal form considerably improves the performance of the algorithm. For unconstrained problems we give a polynomially working method to find the lexicographic best solution.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model is proposed for scheduling activities of periodic type. First a model is proposed for scheduling periodic events with particular time constraints. This problem, which could be considered the extension to periodic phenomena of ordinary scheduling with precedence constraints, is shown to be NP-complete. An algorithm for it of implicit enumeration type is designed based on network flow results, and its average complexity is discussed. Some extensions of the model are considered. The results of this first part serve as a basis in modelling periodic activities using resources. Several cases are considered. Finally some applications are presented for which the proposed model can be a useful tool.},
